# About me
Hi! I am Dynamique Twizere!
I'm a sophomore prospective Computer Science major at Carleton college.
I'm currently working on mastering python before continuing to write any more programs in other languages.
I'm open to collaborating on ANY creative venture, as long as I'm helped to understand the overall direction of it.

Please reach out on linkedIn with any advice, suggestions, questions, collaboration opportunities, or just to say hi!:
